# Kitten app

Build an app with react that allows to get cat pictures by breed. You can use this api [https://docs.thecatapi.com/](https://docs.thecatapi.com/)

The user should be able to login in the app, logout from the app. He should be able to select a cat breed and see pictures of those cats.

##### The app should have:

- ###### Pages
  - An auth page (use a hard coded email/password)
  - A cat page (protected)
  - A card with a dropdown and a submit button to choose a cat category
  - Upon submit you should load the array of cat pictures in the store and display them as a grid just below the card
- ###### Functionalities
  - Logout Functionality
  - Private Route Functionality

You are free to design and organize the app the way you want.
